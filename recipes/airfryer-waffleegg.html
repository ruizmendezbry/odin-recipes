        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Classic egg in a hole is made inside a waffle for a sweet, buttery flavor and added crunch.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
            <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>

            <li>
                Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
